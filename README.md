Handling **Java OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)** effectively, especially as a **Technical Mentor**, involves a mix of **theory, hands-on practice, and real-world examples**. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:  

---

### **1. Understand the Core OOP Concepts in Java**  
Ensure that both you and your students clearly understand the four pillars of OOPs:  

âœ… **Encapsulation** â€“ Binding data and methods together. (`private` variables, `getter` & `setter`)  
âœ… **Abstraction** â€“ Hiding implementation details and showing only functionality. (`abstract class`, `interface`)  
âœ… **Inheritance** â€“ Acquiring properties from a parent class. (`extends`, `super`)  
âœ… **Polymorphism** â€“ Same function behaving differently in different scenarios. (`method overloading`, `method overriding`)  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Use **real-life analogies** like a **car** (Encapsulation: engine hidden inside, Abstraction: steering usage, etc.)

### **2. Teaching Strategy for Java OOPs**  

#### **A. Theoretical Understanding with Examples**  
- Start with **simple explanations** before diving into Java code.  
- Explain **when to use which OOP concept** rather than just syntax.  
- Show **real-world applications** of OOPs in projects.  

#### **B. Hands-on Coding Practice**  
- Start with **basic programs** (creating classes, objects, and constructors).  
- Gradually introduce **advanced topics** like multiple inheritance (`interface`), overriding rules, and design patterns.  
- Encourage **live coding sessions** with students.  

#### **C. Use of Mini-Projects**  
Practical examples help students understand better. Some ideas:  
- **Encapsulation**: A **Bank Account System** (with private balance and getters/setters).  
- **Abstraction**: A **Payment System** (abstract `Payment` class with `CreditCard` and `UPI` subclasses).  
- **Inheritance**: A **Vehicle Hierarchy** (Car, Bike extending `Vehicle`).  
- **Polymorphism**: **Shape Example** (`Circle`, `Rectangle` overriding `draw()`).  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Let students build small projects using all OOP principles.

### **3. Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them**  
ðŸš¨ **Overusing Inheritance** â€“ Teach **Composition over Inheritance** when appropriate.  
ðŸš¨ **Ignoring Encapsulation** â€“ Stress the importance of `private` variables and methods.  
ðŸš¨ **Misunderstanding Polymorphism** â€“ Explain `super` keyword, method overriding vs overloading clearly.  
ðŸš¨ **Skipping Hands-on Practice** â€“ Encourage **writing code**, not just reading it.  

---

### **4. Useful Tools & Resources**  
âœ” **IDEs** â€“ Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code  
âœ” **Online Practice** â€“ LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks  
âœ” **Books** â€“ *Effective Java* by Joshua Bloch, *Head First Java*  
âœ” **YouTube Tutorials** â€“ CodeWithHarry, Java Brains

### **5. Conducting Assessments & Debugging Sessions**  
- **Weekly Quizzes** on concepts like **overriding rules, interfaces vs abstract classes, etc.**  
- **Live Debugging** sessions where students fix OOP-related errors in given code.  
- **Mock Interviews** focusing on **OOP-based coding questions**.
